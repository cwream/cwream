　　　♡　　**c + h**ㅤ◡◡ㅤtotally fine with cuddles! also okay with sibling / friend c + h !! ship cuddles i'll usually only do with friends, or a ship that i lovee - PIXELSHARK, MADOHOMU, SOUKOKU INT ; i'm not comfortable with ship cuddles from a ship i don't support ( aka proships, or ships that don't make sense ) or with strangers

　　　♡　　**skins**ㅤ◡◡ㅤdo not copy my skins ; plain and simple. if you want to take inspiration from my skins, ask or whisper me for permission

　　　♡　　**talking**ㅤ◡◡ㅤi always prefer talking rather than whispering, but please tell me if you're not comfortable with mainly talking publicly !!

　　　♡　　**friending me**ㅤ◡◡ㅤi don't accept friend requests from people i haven't talked to / seen before, if you want to be my friend you can talk to me (or whisper me if you're shy ) i'm also quite forgetful, so i'm sorry if i don't remember you! i also sometimes unfriend people who haven't been active in over a month or people i've barely talked to, just to make some more room ( i know this is cruel, but i always have the max amount of friends... )

　　　♡　　**before interacting**ㅤ◡◡ㅤi'm usually kind of hyper lol, so i sometimes spam expressions, commands through the chat, and i sometimes just crash out and type random stuff and spam it. please tell me if ur uncomfortable with any of these :D

　　　♡　　**status**ㅤ◡◡ㅤ
   
   looking for chat: i'm usually really bored, and need someone to talk to!
   
   idle ( away ): usually either making a pony, or afk! 
   
   do not disturb ( busy ): usually afk, do not interact unless a friend~

   extra: if i'm hiding myself then it probably means DO NOT INTERACT im probably sad or in a bad mood ( will not respond to you )

　　　♡　　also, sorry if i dont respond right away to you, i might be busy, afk, or eating something! i sometimes respond to whispers complimenting my skins, just know that if i dont respond to you, i still appreciate the thought!
