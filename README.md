**c + h**ㅤ|ㅤtotally fine with cuddles! also okay with sibling / friend c + h !! ship cuddles i'll usually only do with friends, or a ship that i love. i'm not comfortable with ship cuddles from a ship i don't support ( aka proships, or ships that don't make sense )

**skins**ㅤ|ㅤdo not copy my skins ; plain and simple. if you want to take inspiration from my skins, ask or whisper me for permission !!

**talking**ㅤ|ㅤi always prefer talking rather than whispering, but please tell me if you're not comfortable with mainly talking publicly !!

**friending me**ㅤ|ㅤi don't accept friend requests from people i haven't talked to / seen before, if you want to be my friend you can talk to me (or whisper me if you're shy ) i'm also qu8te forgetful, so i'm sorry if i don't remember you! i also sometimes unfriend people who haven't been active in over a month or people i've barely talked to, just to make some more room ( i know this is cruel, but i always have the max amount of friends... )
